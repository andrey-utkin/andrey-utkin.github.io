      <description>For the last few weeks my family is up to our ears in maths exercises and brain teasers as my daughter has developed a big interest.&#xA;I am setting up a &amp;ldquo;newsletter&amp;rdquo; for puzzles. Once in a few days I would send a few exercises. Readers can send their solutions if they want, and I will mark them. This would cost a few pounds per month.&#xA;To sign up, email to mathtime@autkin.</description>

I shared what I knew about a less popular system which allows counting to 12 on one hand:&#xA;Finger-counting systems in use in many regions of Asia allow for counting to 12 by using a single hand. The thumb acts as a pointer touching the three finger bones of each finger in turn, starting with the outermost bone of the little finger. One hand is used to count numbers up to 12.</description>
