      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s this DoJ report about abuse of force by Minneapolis police, of George Floyd fame.&#xA;Duration: 4:40:06&#xA;OPUS audio MP3 audio Source code PDF original link PDF cached License: Public domain / CC0. (The original document is public domain.)&#xA;I make &amp;ldquo;audiobooks&amp;rdquo; for myself to consume large texts non-visually, or to augment reading. This is such a case.&#xA;Mostly the results have terrible quality which I got used to. I use open source text to speech systems and pre-process the text only very lightly.</description>
