      <description>About me    I am a professional software developer.
Since the start of my career, I chose to work with systems based on Free and Open Source Software. I have never regretted this choice. The freedoms to use, learn, change and share the code always were important in helping me meet the ever changing needs of myself and others - friends, customers and employers. I am deeply thankful to those who made it possible.</description>
