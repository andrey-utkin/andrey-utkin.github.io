Hello!

Hope you enjoyed the puzzles.
Here are the answers.

1.  My boat has more than 1 circle. It also has 2 more triangles than
    squares.
    Which boat is mine?
    [pictures of 5 boats with shapes: △□△○○, □□△△△○○○, □△□□△△△○, □□□△○○,
    □□△△△△○○○ (TSTCC, SSTTTCCC, STSSTTTC, SSSTCC, SSTTTTCCC)]
    Answer: the fifth boat.

2.  On one island, all inhabitants are either knights, who always tell
    the truth, or knaves, who always lie. Alice and Bob are residents of
    the island of knights and knaves. Alice says: We are both knaves.
    Who is what?

    Answer: Alice is a knave and Bob is a knight. Alice’s statement
    cannot be true, because a knave admitting to being a knave would be
    the same as a liar telling the truth that “I am a liar”, which is
    known as the liar paradox. Since Alice is a knave this means she
    must have been lying about them both being knaves, and so Bob is a
    knight.

3.  You are at the party and you all are having a pizza. You are cutting
    it so that everyone has one piece and nothing is left. Everybody
    loves pizza and wants the biggest piece. But you have to let
    everyone choose their piece first, and take the last piece.
    How do you cut it to take the biggest possible piece to yourself in
    this case?
    Answer is general (doesn’t depend on the size of party or pizza
    shape), but to make a concrete example, suppose there are 4 people
    at the party and it’s a round pizza.

    Answer: Cut it into equal pieces.
