    How do they get across?

3.  There is a barn with a pointed roof. The northern side of its roof
    is 10 degrees steeper than the southern side. The Northern wind is
    blowing at the speed of 1 m/s. At the top of the roof, rooster lays
    an egg. The sun is rising and the high tide was at the noon
    yesterday.
