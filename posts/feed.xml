      <description>Hi dear reader!
It&amp;rsquo;s April 5, 2022, and it&amp;rsquo;s day 41 of a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have just released Kyiv from semi-encirclement, liberated all of the Kyiv region as well as entire north of the country. The previously occupied towns and villages are scenes of thousands of disgusting war crimes committed by the russian beasts.
 Murdered on the spot civilians, some with tied hands, are lying on the streets in great numbers.</description>

      <description>There are many potentially valid reasons you may want to be discriminate to countries on your personal computer or your network infrastructure.
 Distinct country-specific locality of your users or the resources you use. Distinct intensity of cyber attacks or threats. Legal restrictions (data protection laws, trade sanctions).  Particularly relevant, novel motivation as of March 2022 is the boycott of Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
This is a purely technical article about how this can be achieved and what to expect as a result.</description>

      <description>Hello, the Free World!
Not every software geek blog starts with a post about a war. A war which is bad enough to potentially become a world-ending nuclear world war. I am honored by this.
Ukraine, my fatherland, is under an unprovoked and aggressive full-scale military invasion from Russia and its satellite Belarus. You should know this by now, dear reader. But Ukraine fights. Fights with passion. Fights in yet-unseen unity.</description>
