      <description>It was a bit hard to find information about running model training on TensorFlow 2.x on multiple networked machines. But I found enough and made it work, although it worked slower than single-node. See the code here or at GitHub.</description>

      <description>I encountered a really easy and satisfying pixel art editor Piskel. Used it, shown my little daughter, she instantly started creating her own art while really enjoying it. (Before, she used Tux Paint a lot.) I found Piskel while reading about Jugend Hackt, which is even more amazing.</description>

      <description>For the last few weeks my family is up to our ears in maths exercises and brain teasers as my daughter has developed a big interest.
I am setting up a &amp;ldquo;newsletter&amp;rdquo; for puzzles. Once in a few days I would send a few exercises. Readers can send their solutions if they want, and I will mark them. This would cost a few pounds per month.
To sign up, email to mathtime@autkin.</description>

      <description>I have published my small analysis of Android messaging apps: power draw, bandwidth and RAM use.

The most solid conclusion is that Conversations (XMPP) is the most economic, but we need more data to claim anything seriously.</description>

      <description>Today during family dinner my kiddo started finger-counting. I shared what I knew about a less popular system which allows counting to 12 on one hand:
 Finger-counting systems in use in many regions of Asia allow for counting to 12 by using a single hand. The thumb acts as a pointer touching the three finger bones of each finger in turn, starting with the outermost bone of the little finger.</description>

      <description>Hi dear reader!
It&amp;rsquo;s April 5, 2022, and it&amp;rsquo;s day 41 of a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. The Armed Forces of Ukraine have just released Kyiv from semi-encirclement, liberated all of the Kyiv region as well as entire north of the country. The previously occupied towns and villages are scenes of thousands of disgusting war crimes committed by the russian beasts.
 Murdered on the spot civilians, some with tied hands, are lying on the streets in great numbers.</description>

      <description>There are many potentially valid reasons you may want to be discriminate to countries on your personal computer or your network infrastructure.
 Distinct country-specific locality of your users or the resources you use. Distinct intensity of cyber attacks or threats. Legal restrictions (data protection laws, trade sanctions).  Particularly relevant, novel motivation as of March 2022 is the boycott of Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine.
This is a purely technical article about how this can be achieved and what to expect as a result.</description>

      <description>Hello, the Free World!
Not every software geek blog starts with a post about a war. A war which is bad enough to potentially become a world-ending nuclear world war. I am honored by this.
Ukraine, my fatherland, is under an unprovoked and aggressive full-scale military invasion from Russia and its satellite Belarus. You should know this by now, dear reader. But Ukraine fights. Fights with passion. Fights in yet-unseen unity.</description>
